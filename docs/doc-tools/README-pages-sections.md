# OSS Project Docs Tools & Best Practices

How to learn•teach•earn as effectively as possible using open source documentation technologies.

Objective: Minimize time investments required to implement open source software learn-teach-earn cycles.

### Github Readme Doc Standards

Fundamental to understanding this doc:
* Discerning diffs as well as connections between software project docs and softare project wikis.
* Software project docs are for software developers, who team up to build software widgets (swidgets).  
* Like code, a software project readme doc is to be as terse•clear•actionable•testable as possible.
* Making docs and tests first *tends* to produce the best code.  However, as code improves, docs can grow stale.
* Wikis are for the swidget users, so they *tend* to be less terse and more user-friendly.
* Anyone can contribute to open source software projects at many levels.  Docs are a great place to start.

Project name: Your project’s name is the first thing people will see upon scrolling down to your README, and is included upon creation of your README file.

Description: A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!

Your README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis, outlined below.
